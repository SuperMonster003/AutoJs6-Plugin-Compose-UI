# P0.2 in-process loading evidence

Date: 2026-10-02. Scope: the P0 draft and a dedicated debug host, not the frozen V1 contract or
the script-facing `compose` API. P0.3 / Q1 remains a separate decision.

## Sources and isolation

- Plugin baseline: `master@3af9f57`, 1.0.0 / 6. Measurements below used build 6 with the P0.2 changes.
- Host baseline: `e86186920d`, 6.8.0 / 5309. The original host worktree had unrelated uncommitted
  inspector, terminal, package parser and documentation changes. None were changed or staged here.
- Host changes live in the separate `AutoJs6-ComposeUi-Spike` worktree, branch `spike/compose-ui-p0`.
  `-PcomposeUiSpike=true` builds package `org.autojs.autojs6.compose.spike`, with separate providers,
  preferences and test package. Existing AutoJs6 installations were not replaced.
- `plugin-api/compose-ui-api` builds a release AAR with no Compose dependency. The `api.spike`
  package and contract version -1 explicitly distinguish it from the future V1 API.
  SHA-256: `c39b0cc59834d1b9e98d7b2fdde5b8184eae7ff9fe8ff2d32a843f53a44ca437`.
- The debug host upgrades lifecycle 2.6.2 -> 2.9.4, savedstate 1.2.1 -> 1.3.2,
  emoji2 1.3.0 -> 1.4.0 and window 1.0.0 -> 1.5.0. Release host variants are unchanged.
  The baseline's resolved core is already 1.16.0, despite the 1.15.0 catalog declaration.
- `locks/host-shared-deps.lock` is copied identically into both repositories. Its 51 sorted
  `coordinate=version\n` records have SHA-256
  `f3042acc624d499feea9907a20257b62debaa6c523f40bfce19b084274334576`.
  This is a debug experiment fingerprint, not a compatibility guarantee for host build 5308.

## Implementation and observed results

| Check | Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Factory discovery and cast | INFO category + application factory metadata; `PathClassLoader(apk, apk!/lib/<process ABI>, host.classLoader)` | Successful on debug and release plugin APKs |
| Class identity | Factory returns actual `Class` objects, compared with the host loader | Compose UI/runtime from plugin; contract, Kotlin, CoroutineContext, coroutines, core, activity, appcompat, lifecycle and savedstate from host |
| Activity owner chain | AppCompatActivity, as used by ScriptExecuteActivity; identity of both view-tree owners checked | Compose attaches and renders |
| Counter round trip | Accessibility node click on `+1`, queued host callback, replacement UiNode tree, accessibility text `Count: 1` | Successful; no synchronous callback during composition |
| RawWindow | Real host RawWindow/FloatyService; no initial owner; explicit LifecycleRegistry and SavedStateRegistryController attached before adding the view | Composition created, attached and disposed on close |
| Material resource table | Pinned Material 3 `m3c_dialog` resolved through public Resources lookup; compared against independently configured plugin resources | English, Chinese and Arabic resolve; density 240 and night mode match supplied Configuration |
| Theme | ContextWrapper retains Activity theme and window/system services | No getTheme override needed for this counter; broader components are not yet verified |
| Native search path | Factory iterates a Compose Path with move/line/close and asserts 3 segments | API 33 exercises graphics-path JNI; API 37 uses the platform iterator |
| Exit | DisposableEffect creation/disposal parity, no live composition, Recomposer reaches ShutDown after Activity destroy | Successful |
| Input limits | SpikeTreeTest exercises snapshot detachment, unsupported types, leaf children, callback id, node count, depth and text boundaries | 5 JVM tests pass; invalid replacement is rejected before state publication |
| Failure gates | Device test checks missing/disabled/unauthorized eligibility snapshots, host-version and draft-version rejection, missing reflective class; actual PluginEnableStore disable/restore | Distinct typed codes; absence and authorization are injected gate inputs, not destructive package/signer changes |

Resource and accessibility checks are deliberately separate: accessibility is read from the actual
Material Button/Text tree, while the private Material resource name is a diagnostic lookup only.
No private Compose API is linked and no TalkBack manual acceptance or broad Material component
coverage is claimed. The resource is retained explicitly in `raw/compose_spike_keep.xml`.

## R8 findings that debug builds did not reveal

1. Removing Kotlin from the plugin APK is not viable while the Kotlin INFO service runs in the
   plugin process. It remains bundled, but must preserve its ABI for parent-first rendering.
2. Default R8 renamed CoroutineContext to `s9`. AndroidUiDispatcher inherits the host coroutine
   hierarchy, causing `ClassCastException: d3 cannot be cast to s9` during view creation.
3. Keeping Kotlin types and members still allowed R8 8.13.19 to synthesize optimized facade methods.
   A call to `CollectionsKt.f(Iterable)` failed with NoSuchMethodError because the parent copy has
   no such method. P0 therefore uses `-dontoptimize`, retains shrinking and obfuscation, keeps
   `kotlin.**`, and repackages other obfuscated classes under the plugin's private namespace.
4. compileOnly lifecycle-viewmodel does not contribute its consumer rules to plugin R8.
   `LifecycleRetainedValuesStoreOwner` lost its reflected constructor and failed at Activity view
   attachment. The relevant ViewModel no-arg constructor rule is now explicitly included.
5. Both complete device suites passed after these corrections. `.python/verify_apk_classpath.py`
   audits DEX definitions, required Kotlin names, absence of the draft contract, and absence of
   shared AndroidX/coroutines copies. Gradle separately checks dependency versions and exclusions.

The IDE debugger could not access the host worktree from the plugin project (outside-project
path rejection). Diagnosis used real device exception stacks, R8 mapping and repeated instrumented
reproductions. No debugger values or heap-leak analysis are claimed.

## Device evidence

| Device | API / ABI / page size | Plugin debug | Plugin release | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Redmi 22120RN86C, serial bek749scrwv4wo8h | 33 / arm64-v8a / 4096 | 5 host probe tests pass | 5 host probe tests pass | E3 |
| AVD_API_37.1_16K, serial emulator-5574 | 37 / x86_64 / 16384 | 5 host probe tests pass | 5 host probe tests pass | E2 |

Both use the actual host app code, dedicated debug package, host build 5309 and plugin build 6.
The plugin activation/discovery suite also passed on API 37 (5 tests, debug plugin); API 33 uses
the matching debug plugin and debug instrumentation package. A debug instrumentation APK cannot
be run against the minified release target's removed R classes; release rendering is tested by
the host suite instead.

The following are single observations in separate fresh instrumentation processes, each running
only the PSS method against the release plugin. Debug.MemoryInfo values are KiB. GC and a 500 ms
settling interval precede each reading; they include Activity/window and concurrent host startup
work, so they are not a pure renderer allocation benchmark or a regression threshold.

| Device | Before mount | After mount | After destroy | Mount delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Redmi API 33 | 215976 | 229078 | 230295 | +13102 |
| API 37 / 16 KB AVD | 213067 | 213495 | 215627 | +428 |

After-destroy PSS does not return to baseline, as loaded classes, resource caches and host work
remain. Composition/recomposer shutdown is asserted independently; no general absence-of-leaks
claim is inferred from PSS. LeakCanary/heap retention analysis belongs to the later robustness gate.

Build-6 APK observations after the final R8 correction: debug 9,275,784 bytes / 88,417 DEX method
references; release 1,459,210 bytes / 28,213 references. Counts sum DEX method-id tables, not just
declared methods. Signed distribution and 16 KB native alignment use appendDigestToReleasedFiles.

Final metadata build 7 was rechecked before committing: the release plugin passed all 5 host
probe tests again on both devices. The local signed artifact is
`releases/autojs6-plugin-compose-ui-v1.0.0-f7a437db.apk` (1,459,210 bytes). Build-7 debug APK is
9,223,166 bytes. JVM tests: 24 passed. Lint debug: no issues. Lint release: zero errors, three
unused identity-resource warnings (plugin_engine / plugin_id / plugin_variant, referenced by
contract tests). Native inventory, signature, CRC32 and 16 KB alignment gates passed.
Workflow structure and paths were reviewed locally; PyYAML is unavailable and remote CI was not run.

```

Host (from the isolated worktree):

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat '-PcomposeUiSpike=true' '-Pautojs.gradle.build.number.auto.increment.enabled=false' '-Pautojs.gradle.build.time.update.enabled=false' :plugin-api:compose-ui-api:assembleRelease :app:verifyComposeUiSharedClasspath :app:assembleAppDebug :app:assembleAppDebugAndroidTest

```

Install the matching ABI host APK, the host test APK and one plugin variant first. Tests use their
own host preference space and restore the enable state. For cold PSS, force-stop only the dedicated
test host and append `#pssBeforeLoadAfterLoadAndAfterDestroy` to the test class name. Never replace
or clear a user's installed host to run this probe.

## P0.3 handoff and limits

Q1 recommendation: upgrade host shared dependencies to the verified debug versions, then run host
regressions before promoting the loader. Do not enable the isolated-loader fallback without a new
experiment. P0.3 still needs the maintainer decision and retirement/promotion of the debug entry.
P1 must replace the draft API, pin a real minimum host build, negotiate the fingerprint, cache
loaders, handle package updates, and add host-release R8 rules for every shared class boundary.
The current spike is not a production error-containment or script-session implementation.

Not run in this P0.2 session: API 24/28/31/35 host loading matrix, a minified host APK, TalkBack
manual traversal, broad component/theme/IME coverage, LeakCanary and CI remote execution (D7).
These remain later gates; only the two devices above are used as new functional evidence.

Public references: [PathClassLoader constructors](https://developer.android.com/reference/dalvik/system/PathClassLoader)
and [Compose in Views lifecycle disposal](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/migrate/interoperability-apis/compose-in-views).
The results and R8 exceptions above are local observations, not conclusions inferred from those documents.

Local host commit: `21dff98f26` on `spike/compose-ui-p0`. The plugin change is the commit containing
this evidence (VERSION_BUILD=7). All four temporary packages were removed from both test devices;
the original host builds remain (Redmi 5310, AVD 5304). The AVD started by this session was stopped.
